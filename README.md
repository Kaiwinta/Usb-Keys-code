# Usb-Keys-code

This code is a compilation of all i know about .batch files
The point of this is to created some batch files to improve myself in this
Some of them will be with an autorun files to put them on a key
Apo autorun is to put on the keys to allow autorun on every computer

If anyone has some good batch command i'll be happy to learn them
